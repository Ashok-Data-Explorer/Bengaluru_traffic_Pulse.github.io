            <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
            <p>This dataset includes several features that contribute to traffic congestion prediction. The data points include the date when the traffic data was recorded, the name of the area or locality, and the specific road or intersection name within the area. Traffic Volume represents the number of vehicles passing through the road or intersection, while Average Speed reflects the average speed of vehicles in kilometers per hour (km/h). The Travel Time Index is an index representing the travel time relative to a baseline, and the Congestion Level is a numerical representation of the level of congestion. Road Capacity Utilization indicates the percentage of road capacity being utilized. Incident Reports capture the number of reported incidents or accidents, and Environmental Impact is a measure of the environmental consequences of traffic. Public Transport Usage shows the level of usage of public transportation in the area, and Traffic Signal Compliance measures adherence to traffic signals. Parking Usage reveals the level of parking space utilization, while Pedestrian and Cyclist Count records the number of pedestrians and cyclists. Finally, the Weather Conditions during data recording and any Roadwork or Construction Activity are also considered to assess their impact on traffic congestion.</p>
